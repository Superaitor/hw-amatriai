Problem 6 
3. You can overwrite it because when you call free_chars on a character pointer (c1), it will delete everything in the buffer after that character pointer, including everything in that character pointer and unfortunately, everything afterwards as well. So if someone had put values from a different character pointer (c2) into the buffer after c1, everything from c2 would also be deleted, making it possible to overwrite something that shouldn't have been overwritten.
